## About the Game

The Dancing Snake is a popular arcade game that has been around for decades. The player controls a snake that moves around the screen, collecting food. Each time the snake eats, it grows longer. The objective is to keep the snake from running into the walls or its own body while collecting as much food as possible.

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
2. The snake will move continuously in the chosen direction.
